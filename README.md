> Chord / Scale finder (Work in progress)
Welcome to the chord scale finder. 
The goal is to have a clean and intuitive interface/tool for musicians to work and learn with.
The app provides:
- Look up chords, alternate chords and their inversions
- Look up scales and alternate scales
- Creating a chord progression
- Suggesting scales and chords to use over a certain chord in a progression.
- Learning new concepts in music through various topics: Substitute dominants, Modal interchange, Borrowed chords etc. 
- Using either a (highly customizable) fretboard or a piano for learning. 
These will have different tunings, sounds, themes etc.
- Ability to save projects without creating a profile
- Creating a profile, saving (optionally private) projects.
- Browsing projects created by other users

<Bugs>
- Fretboard scroll on mobile is weird, starts from the last place it was scrolled to 
and will scroll on every touch, while it should only scroll when the fretboard is touched
